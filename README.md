# COMP1073-Lab-2


#### **Lab 2**

**DESCRIPTION**

In pairs or groups of three, build a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface that features an object constructor and an object based on a **fictional job applicant profile** that you are provided in class.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

**As a team, complete each of the below tasks:**

1. Carefully analyze every detail featured in the **job applicant profile sheet** provided to your group.
2. Create a local repository for the code that you are about to generate.
3. Develop a JavaScript constructor that would enable a programmer to create one or more instances of the applicant profile you have in front of you.
4. Include 10–15 object properties that might describe every aspect of the applicant – include a variety of types of data (e.g., strings, arrays, booleans, numbers).
5. Build a simple HTML/CSS page to use to create one or more object instances based on your constructor and to feature the applicant(s) in some imaginative way – for example, like a resume card or applicant preview.
6. Perhaps add some interaction that would allow the user to access or modify the object properties somehow?
7. Stage, comment, commit, and push the code to a remote repository (to show your progress as you worked through the challenge).
8. Have fun!

**SUBMISSION**

Have one person in your group submit the URL for the remote repository - enable page browsing (Github Pages).
